Adding a backend database to the SpringBoot application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise we will add a backend database to the previous deployed
SpringBoot application.

If you already created the SpringBoot application in the previous lab
link:14.%20Deploy%20a%20Spring%20Boot%20Application.md[deploy a spring
boot application], just test one more thing. Try your application url
with `/dbtest`
(http://bootapp-spring-UserName.apps.workshop.osecloud.com/dbtest
*substitute* UserName) extension and it should list you some data from
the HSQLDB configured within the same app.

Let’s take a moment to understand how this application is connecting to
the HSQLDB. Look at the `application.properties` file in the code
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/application.properties
and we have configured these spring datasource variables to use hsqldb.

....
spring.datasource.platform=hsqldb
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:hsqldb:file:/opt/app-root/src/mydb;shutdown=true
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
....

Of course,
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/pom.xml
has the required dependencies. So springboot is able to create the in
memory database.

Where is the data coming from? See these two files:

* https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema-hsqldb.sql
is creating the schema
* https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/data-hsqldb.sql
is adding data.

This is the data displayed when you invoke dbtest endpoint. Pretty
straight forward.. isn’t it!!

In this lab, we will deploy the same as a 2-tier application by adding a
MySQL database running as a separate pod.

*Step 1: Add a MySQL database to this project*

Based on what you learnt in the previous labs, you know what to do!!

Make sure you are in the `spring-UserName` project where your springboot
application is running. Click on `Add to project` on your webconsole,
select `MySQL Ephemeral` from the catalog and deploy it. When you are
deploying this database you will have to choose the following values:

*Database Service Name:* mysql +
*MySQL Connection Username:* user +
*MySQL Connection Password:* password +
*MySQL Database Name:* sampledb

_Feel free to use your own values, but make a note of the same_ (write
down..we will need these)

Click on the `Create` button and within a few min or two your MySQL
database pod should be up and running.

*Step 2: Configuring database connection params*

The simplest way is to edit `application.properties` file to the values
you noted in the last step i.e.

....
spring.datasource.platform=mysql
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-UserName:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
....

But wait, that requires you to rebuild the code and deploy.

So, is there another way?.. *Yes* Let’s use a `ConfigMap`.

ConfigMaps allow you to keep the configuration artifacts decoupled from
the image content. More details
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/dev_guide/configmaps.html[here].
We will see use them here and understand their _flexibility_ in the next
lab.

Lets go to CLI.

Change to `spring-UserName` project

....
oc project spring-UserName
....

Create a new file with name `application.properties` with the following
content.

....
spring.datasource.platform=mysql
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-UserName:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
....

You need to make sure that you substitute the correct values you noted
in the last step when you are creating the service. *Be extra-careful..
read instructions below.*

Specifically note the datasource url. It is in the following format:

`spring.datasource.url = jdbc:<<databasetype>>://<<service-host>>:<<service-port>>/<<dbname>>?useSSL=false`

You can replace `service-host` by the IP address of your MySQL service
or the Service name. In the above example, I am using the service name
for example `mysql.spring-user01`. Here `mysql` is the name of the
service and `spring-user01` is the project name. This is a fully
qualified way to let your application do service discovery in OpenShift
(it uses SkyDNS).

Now let’s create a ConfigMap with name `app-props` by running

....
$ oc create configmap app-props --from-file=application.properties
configmap "app-props" created
....

Try a couple of more commands

....
$ oc describe configmap app-props
Name:       app-props
Namespace:  spring-UserName
Labels:     <none>
Annotations:    <none>

Data
====
application.properties: 328 bytes
....

If you made a mistake you can always edit the ConfigMap using

....
oc edit configmap app-props
....

So far, we have created a ConfigMap in the project but your springboot
application does not know how to use it.

*Step 3: Edit Deployment Configuration*

Now we will mount the ConfigMap so that the springboot application can
use it. You can either edit from CLI or from WebConsole.

* If using WebConsole, navigate to
`Applications`->`Deployments`->`bootapp`. The screen should show
Deployment Configuration details for the `bootapp` application. On the
right top, choose `Actions` dropdown and `Edit YAML`.
* If you are doing from CLI, you can run `oc edit dc bootapp`

Scroll down to container spec, that looks like this:

....
    spec:
      containers:
        -
          name: bootapp
          image: '172.30.85.130:5000/spring-veer/bootapp@sha256:79e188d712e1209b933870c7d064423af281f16b371fb5e5911dfb09a6867776'
          ports:
            -
              containerPort: 8080
              protocol: TCP
          resources:
          terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
          imagePullPolicy: Always
      restartPolicy: Always
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      securityContext:
....

Note there could be multiple `spec`s in your DC.

We will now add a volume that points to our ConfigMap right under
`spec`. It is explained here
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/dev_guide/configmaps.html#configmaps-use-case-consuming-in-volumes

....
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: app-props-volume
      configMap:
        name: app-props
....

*Be super-careful with indentation*

We will now add `volumeMount` to mount the `volume` that we just added
into the pod. It should be right under the container `name:` as shown
below.

....
      containers:
        -
          name: bootapp
          volumeMounts:
          - name: app-props-volume
            mountPath: /opt/app-root/src/config
....

*Be super-careful with indentation*

After the changes, the `template` section in the dc, should now look
like this

....
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: bootapp
        deploymentconfig: bootapp
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: app-props-volume
          configMap:
            name: app-props
      containers:
        -
          name: bootapp
          volumeMounts:
          - name: app-props-volume
            mountPath: /opt/app-root/src/config
          image: '172.30.85.130:5000/spring-veer/bootapp@sha256:79e188d712e1209b933870c7d064423af281f16b371fb5e5911dfb09a6867776'
          ports:
            -
              containerPort: 8080
              protocol: TCP
          resources:
          terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
          imagePullPolicy: Always
      restartPolicy: Always
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      securityContext:
....

Optional: you can run the following to do the update on the
deploymentConfig:

....
    oc set volumes dc/bootapp --add -m /opt/app-root/src/config --configmap-name=app-props
....

So what is this location `/opt/app-root/src/config`?

If you get into the terminal of the pod (you should know how to do this
by now!) and run `pwd`, it will show that the `home` directory is
`/opt/app-root/src`. If you copy the `application.properties` file in
the `config` folder, SpringBoot will pick that first. Hence we mounted
the folder `/opt/app-root/src/config`.

Save the changes and exit. If you now got the `Overview` page, you will
see that the pod gets re-deployed. Yes, redeployed, not rebuilt (no S2I
build process).

*Step 4: Verify the changes*

Once the deployment is complete +
* click on the pod circle +
* click on the pod name +
* get into the `Terminal` tab +
* verify that your `application.properties` are now available in the
`config` folder

....
sh-4.2$ ls config
application.properties
sh-4.2$ cat config/application.properties
# replace your own values based on the database service you created
# url = jdbc:mysql://<<service-host>>:<<service-port>>/<<dbname>>?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.platform=mysql
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-veer:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
....

Note the contents of this file are what you added to the ConfigMap.

*Step 5: Test your application*

Go back to the `Overview` page. Click on your application url which
would be something like
`http://bootapp-spring-UserName.apps.workshop.osecloud.com/`

It will open a new tab and your running application will greet you

`Hello from bootapp-2-06a4b`

Now move back to your webconsole and watch the pod logs. You can also do
this from CLI by running

....
oc logs -f bootapp-2-06a4b
....

Now access the application with the `/dbtest` extension -
`http://bootapp-spring-UserName.apps.workshop.osecloud.com/dbtest`

It should show the data from your MySQL database.

....
Customers List


CustomerId: 2 Customer Name: Joe Mysql Age: 88
CustomerId: 3 Customer Name: Jack Mysql Age: 54
CustomerId: 4 Customer Name: Ann Mysql Age: 32
....

Where did this data come from? Look at *
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema-mysql.sql
was used to initialize the MySQL database *
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/data-mysql.sql
was used to populate data. I added `Mysql' as part of the names to make
it easy ;)

Also note that your logs show the connection url, just to verify which
database you are connecting to.

....
connection url: jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-UserName:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
....

*Bonus Points:* Log into the MySQL instance and verify the data in the
customer table for extra points!!

In this lab exercise, you have learnt how to set up a multi-tiered
application and also to pass configuration information using ConfigMaps.
In the next lab, we will learn to use ConfigMaps to dynamically update
the configuration without restarting the pod!!
