Dynamic configuration updates using ConfigMap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab, we will learn how to dynamically update this configuration
in a running pod. We will do this with an example by changing the
database connection to use a PostgreSQL database.

In the last
link:16.%20Adding%20database%20to%20your%20Spring%20Boot%20Application.md[lab],
we created a configuration to connect to the MySQL database by mounting
`application.properties` file using ConfigMap.

*Step 1: Create PostgreSQL Pod*

Ensure you are in the `spring-UserName` project. *Substitute UserName
with your own userid*

Based on what you have learnt in the previous labs, create a new
Postgresql database pod i.e. `Add to project`, search for `postgresql`,
choose `postgresql-ephemeral`. You will need to key in the following
values.

*Database Service Name:* postgresql +
*MySQL Connection Username:* user +
*MySQL Connection Password:* password +
*MySQL Database Name:* sampledb

_Feel free to use your own values, but make a note of the same_ (write
down..we will need these)

*Step 2: Add data to the database*

While the code has `schema-postgresql.sql` and `data-postgresql.sql`
files, these scripts will only be executed if the pod restarts. Since we
are going to use this database without restarting the bootapp pod, we
will add the data manually.

Select the `postgresql` pod and navigate to the `terminal`.

Login to the database from CLI

....
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U $POSTGRESQL_USER -q -d $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE
....

This will log you into the psql CLI.

Now create the table using the script

....
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customer (
   CUST_ID serial primary key,
   NAME varchar(100) NOT NULL,
   AGE integer NOT NULL);
....

and then add some data as shown below. You can change the values if you
wish.

....
insert into customer (name,age) values ('Joe Psql', 88);
insert into customer (name,age) values ('Jack Psql', 54);
insert into customer (name,age) values ('Ann Psql', 32);
....

These scripts are available here -
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema-postgresql.sql

https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/data-postgresql.sql

Here is how I added the data in the terminal

....
sh-4.2$ psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U $POSTGRESQL_USER -q -d $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE
sampledb=> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customer (
sampledb(>    CUST_ID serial primary key,
sampledb(>    NAME varchar(100) NOT NULL,
sampledb(>    AGE integer NOT NULL);
sampledb=> insert into customer (name,age) values ('Joe Psql', 88);
sampledb=> insert into customer (name,age) values ('Jack Psql', 54);
sampledb=> insert into customer (name,age) values ('Ann Psql', 32);
sampledb=> select * from customer;
 cust_id |   name    | age
---------+-----------+-----
       1 | Joe Psql  |  88
       2 | Jack Psql |  54
       3 | Ann Psql  |  32
(3 rows)

sampledb=> \q
....

*Step 3: Update ConfigMap*

Now let us update the ConfigMap to change the `application.properties`
to point to `postgresql` datasource.

Using CLI run the following command after you ensure you are in the
`spring-UserName` project

....
$ oc edit configmap app-props
....

Edit the datasource parameters as below

....
    spring.datasource.platform=postgresql
    spring.datasource.url= jdbc:postgresql://postgresql.spring-UserName:5432/sampledb
    spring.datasource.username=user
    spring.datasource.password=password
....

*Do this slowly. Double check every parameter*

Specifically note the `spring.datasource.url`. It is in the following
format:

`spring.datasource.url = jdbc:<<databasetype>>://<<service-host>>:<<service-port>>/<<dbname>>`

Here

* databasetype is `postgresql` +
* service-host can be ip-address of the service or the service name.
Above, it is configured as service-name.projectname. This is the fully
qualified service name discoverable by kubernetes. Kubernetes uses
SkyDNS. +
* service-port for postgresql is `5432`

*Note* that this change does not redeploy the pod. You can check the pod
details to see how long the pod has been running for.

Now verify the `application.properties` inside the pod (Go to bootapp
pod terminal on the Web Console or use oc rsh) . You will note that the
`application.properties` file is now updated as a result of updating the
ConfigMap.

....
sh-4.2$ cat config/application.properties
spring.datasource.platform=postgresql
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:postgresql://postgresql.spring-veer:5432/sampledb
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
....

*Step 4: Test the application connection*

Click the application url now i.e
`http://bootapp-spring-UserName.apps.workshop.osecloud.com/`. It will open
a new tab and greets you

....
Hello from bootapp-2-06a4b
....

Also watch the pod logs either using web console or using CLI. For
example `oc logs -f bootapp-2-06a4b` Watch out for connection url in the
output.

Now try the `/dbtest` endpoint i.e.
`http://bootapp-spring-veer.apps.workshop.osecloud.com/dbtest`.

*Note* that the output is still from the MySQLDB.

....
Customers List


CustomerId: 2 Customer Name: Joe Mysql Age: 88
CustomerId: 3 Customer Name: Jack Mysql Age: 54
CustomerId: 4 Customer Name: Ann Mysql Age: 32
....

Also the pod logs show that connection url is

....
connection url: jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-veer:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
....

So even after the `application.properties` file is updated in the pod,
it is not picked up. The reason is that springboot app caches the
environment variables. This application has a `@RefreshScope`
annotation. So we can invoke `/refresh` endpoint to refresh the cache.
Run the following command from CLI to refresh the cache.

....
$ curl -X POST http://bootapp-spring-veer.apps.workshop.osecloud.com/refresh
["spring.datasource.url","spring.datasource.platform"]
....

Now note that the pod logs show that the application context is
refreshed.

....
2016-11-18 04:25:35.601  INFO 10 --- [io-8080-exec-10] s.c.a.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext : Refreshing
....

Now try the `/dbtest` endpoint again. Now the result will show the data
from the postgresql database.

....
Customers List


CustomerId: 1 Customer Name: Joe Psql Age: 88
CustomerId: 2 Customer Name: Jack Psql Age: 54
CustomerId: 3 Customer Name: Ann Psql Age: 32
....

Also note the logs will show the connection url as

....
connection url: jdbc:postgresql://postgresql.spring-UserName:5432/sampledb
....

*Note* in this exercise, the pod was never redeployed. The
application.properties were dynamically updated.

*Summary:* In this lab, we have learnt the ConfigMap’s flexibility and
how it allows dynamic updates to the pod configuration.
