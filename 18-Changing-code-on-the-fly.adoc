Changing code on the fly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab, we will learn how to make changes to the code on the local
machine and immediately sync it with the code running in a pod.

*Note:* This model of programming is useful for interpreted languages.

*Prerequisite:* This lab assumes that you have git installed on your box

*Step 1: Create a new project* +
Create a new project on the OpenShift cluster with name
`synccode-UserName`. *Note* Substitute the `UserName` with your `userId`

*Step 2: Clone the git repository locally* Clone the following git
repository to your workstation.
https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/nodejs-hello using the command

....
$ git clone https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/nodejs-hello
....

This is a very simple nodejs application. Feel free to understand the
code.

*Step 3: Create the application*

Change to the `nodejs-hello` folder.

....
$ cd nodejs-hello
....

Now let us create an application using this code.

....
$ oc new-app .
--> Found image 448a51d (11 weeks old) in image stream "nodejs" in project "openshift" under tag "4" for "nodejs"

    Node.js 4
    ---------
    Platform for building and running Node.js 4 applications

    Tags: builder, nodejs, nodejs4

    * The source repository appears to match: nodejs
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/nodejs-hello.git#master will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "nodejs-hello:latest"
      * Use 'start-build' to trigger a new build
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "nodejs-hello"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "nodejs-hello"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "nodejs-hello"

--> Creating resources with label app=nodejs-hello ...
    imagestream "nodejs-hello" created
    buildconfig "nodejs-hello" created
    deploymentconfig "nodejs-hello" created
    service "nodejs-hello" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/nodejs-hello' to track its progress.
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
....

Create a route

....
$ oc expose service nodejs-hello
route "nodejs-hello" exposed
....

Wait for the build to complete and test the application

....
$ oc get route
NAME           HOST/PORT                                          PATH      SERVICES       PORT       TERMINATION
nodejs-hello   nodejs-hello-rsync-UserName.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}             nodejs-hello   8080-tcp
....

....
$ $ curl nodejs-hello-rsync-UserName.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}
Welcome to OpenShift!! My HostName is: nodejs-hello-1-8qigc
....

*Step 4: Make code changes and sync with rsync*

Let us now make a small change to the application on your workstation.

Edit `server.js` file using your favorite text editor (I use vi). The
code snippet below displays the welcome message

....
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Welcome to OpenShift!! My HostName is: ' + os.hostname() + '\n');
});
....

Let us make a small change to insert a `\n` character after the welcome
message so that the hostname is displayed on a different line. The
edited code should look like this.

....
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Welcome to OpenShift!! \n My HostName is: ' + os.hostname() + '\n');
});
....

Run `oc get pods` to get your application pod name as shown below:

....
$ oc get pods
NAME                   READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
nodejs-hello-1-8qigc   1/1       Running     0          8m
nodejs-hello-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          9m
....

Use `oc rsync` to sync the code from the local workstation to the pod as
shown below

....
$ oc rsync . nodejs-hello-1-8qigc:/opt/app-root/src --no-perms=true --exclude=.git
building file list ... done

sent 89 bytes  received 20 bytes  2.29 bytes/sec
total size is 805  speedup is 7.39
....

The command above will copy the code from the local machine to the pod.
Note that +
* `/opt/app-root/src` is the default home location on the pod +
* `--exclude=.git` will omit the hidden git folder

Now test the application again. This time it should show the output in
two lines as below:

....
$ curl nodejs-hello-rsync-UserName.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}
Welcome to OpenShift!!
My HostName is: nodejs-hello-1-8qigc
....

Note that pod did not restart, we did not have to check into git repo
and rebuild the image. The changes moved from your workstation directly
to the pod.

Developers can use this mechanism to quickly test the changes on the
fly. When ready they can commit the changes to the source control
repository.

You can repeat a few more changes and enjoy the rsync!!!
