Using SSL in your application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise you will set up your application to encrypt traffic
with the OpenShift Wildcard certificate.

*Step 1: Switch to an existing project*

For this exercise, we will use an application that we created before. We
will be using the *myjbossapp-UserName* that you created in the previous
labs. Make sure you are switched to that project by using the *oc
project* command. *Remember* to substitute UserName.

....
$ oc project myjbossapp-UserName
....

*Step 2: View the routing config*

To view the routing config you will need to use the `oc get route`
command

....
$ oc get route/ks -o yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/host.generated: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2016-10-06T06:28:23Z
  labels:
    app: ks
  name: ks
  namespace: myjbossapp-admin
  resourceVersion: "33256"
  selfLink: /oapi/v1/namespaces/myjbossapp-admin/routes/ks
  uid: 14cf078c-8b8e-11e6-ba5b-080027782cf7
spec:
  host: ks-myjbossapp-UserName.apps.workshop.osecloud.com
  port:
    targetPort: 8080-tcp
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: ks
    weight: 100
status:
  ingress:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2016-10-06T06:28:23Z
      status: "True"
      type: Admitted
    host: ks-myjbossapp-UserName.apps.workshop.osecloud.com
    routerName: router
....

Note here that the `host:` is set to the FQDN that your application is
running on.

Currently the routing component of OpenShift 3 supports ports `80` and
`443`. When you first create your route, the mapping of `80` to your pod
is done automatically. There are a few things that need to be done in
order to get the `443` mapping to work.

*Step 3: TLS Edge Termination*

OpenShift has a _wildcard_ SSL certificate that it can use for any
application. We can use this SSL certificate to serve SSL from our
application without having to generate a cert of our own (which is
sometimes called SSL-offloading).

Edit your routing configuration:

....
oc edit route/ks
....

You are going to add `tls: termination: edge` right below the `host:`
section. It should look something like this.

....
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/host.generated: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2015-12-22T03:56:30Z
  labels:
    app: ks
  name: ks
  namespace: myjbossapp-shchan
  resourceVersion: "2903142"
  selfLink: /oapi/v1/namespaces/myjbossapp-shchan/routes/ks
  uid: fba5d1e6-a85f-11e5-be21-fa163ec58dad
spec:
  host: ks-myjbossapp-UserName.apps.workshop.osecloud.com
  tls:
    termination: edge
  port:
    targetPort: "8080"
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: ks
status: {}
....

*Step 4: Verify*

Verify by visiting your page by using the `https://` URI

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about service SSL
