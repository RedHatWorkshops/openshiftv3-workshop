Code Promotion across Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab we will learn how an application image binary can be
promoted across the environments. As an example we will use development
and QA environments as promotion to pre-prod and production will be very
similar.

In this example we are using projects as means of separation of
environments (development, qa, production).

*Step 1: Create two projects*

Using the knowledge you gained from the past create two projects.

Name the first project *development-UserName*

....
$ oc new-project development-UserName
....

Name the second *testing-UserName*.
....
$ oc new-project testing-UserName
....

Also *remember* to substitute the username!

*Step 2: Provide ImagePuller Access to the QA Project from Development
Project*

The following command will allow the QA project to be able to pull the
docker images from the Development project.

....
$ oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:testing-UserName -n development-UserName
....

*Step 3: Create an application in the development project*

Switch over to the *development-UserName* project and deploy an
application using the `php` s2i builder. You can use webconsole or
command line. The command line option is shown below.

*Bonus points:* Clone this application to your own github account and
deploy it so that you can redeploy with changes later.

....
oc project development-UserName
oc new-app openshift/php~https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/welcome-php
....

*Step 4: Tag the docker image*

Wait until the application gets built and deployed. Now if you check the
imagestreams you will find the docker image for this application.

Now find the imagestream name using the following command. `is` is the
short form for `imageStream`.

....
$ oc get is
NAME          DOCKER REPO                                                       TAGS      UPDATED
welcome-php   docker-registry.default.svc:5000/development-UserName/welcome-php
....

Now describe this image stream to get the full image id:

....
$ oc describe is welcome-php
Name:			welcome-php
Namespace:		development-UserName
Created:		7 minutes ago
Labels:			app=welcome-php
Annotations:		openshift.io/generated-by=OpenShiftNewApp
			openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=2017-08-21T23:24:26Z
Docker Pull Spec:	docker-registry.default.svc:5000/development-UserName/welcome-php
Unique Images:		1
Tags:			1

  pushed image

  * docker-registry.default.svc:5000/development-UserName/welcome-php@sha256:157334d73dfc8dfdf733257b05c3fecaee236d36f69afa207395715fbe882abf
      4 minutes ago

....

In this case, the full image Id is

....
docker-registry.default.svc:5000/development-UserName/welcome-php@sha256:157334d73dfc8dfdf733257b05c3fecaee236d36f69afa207395715fbe882abf

....

Now let us assume that this docker image is good and is ready to promote
to QA. Let us tag this docker image using the `oc tag` command.

The format is

....
oc tag FullImageId development-UserName/myapp:promote-qa
....

Check the following commands and replace the values where needed:

....
$ oc tag \
docker-registry.default.svc:5000/development-UserName/welcome-php@sha256:157334d73dfc8dfdf733257b05c3fecaee236d36f69afa207395715fbe882abf \
development-UserName/welcome-php:promote-qa

Tag welcome-php:promote-qa set to docker-registry.default.svc:5000/development-UserName/welcome-php@sha256:157334d73dfc8dfdf733257b05c3fecaee236d36f69afa207395715fbe882abf.


$ oc describe is welcome-php
Name:			welcome-php
Namespace:		development-UserName
Created:		4 minutes ago
Labels:			app=welcome-php

....

*Step 5: Deploy the application to QA*

Now you can switch over to the QA project and deploy the docker image
that we tagged in development. Also expose service to create route for
this project and *remember* to substitute username.

....
oc project testing-UserName
oc new-app development-UserName/welcome-php:promote-qa
oc expose service welcome-php
....

Test this application in the QA project. Note that we deployed the
docker image from the development project without rebuilding the code.

*Bonus points*: Make changes to your git repo (to
`index.php`) and deploy it to development first.
Notice that your changes are seen only in development project. Repeat
the changes a couple of times. Now find the latest imagestream and tag
it as promote-qa. Watch out that the QA project gets redeployed when you
update the new tag.

Congratulations!! you now know how to promote your application across
environments in OpenShift 3.
