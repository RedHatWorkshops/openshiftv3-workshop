Using Web Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab exercise, we will review the OpenShift Web Console.

Open a browser and type in the master public URL {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}. You will be directed to an OpenShift
login page.

*Note*: Your browser may complain about the serverâ€™s security
certificates not trusted by your computer. You can agree to proceed to
the master URL.

Key in the username and password provided by the instructor. You will now
see the Service Catalog. Your created project will be listed on the right

Click on "View All" on the right. You will see the list of projects now.
Note the project you created in the last lab exercise is shown here.

Also note the *Create Project* button which allows you to create a new
project from Web Console.

Now click on the CLI Project to view the details. OpenShift takes you by
default to the *Overview* page and shows you a graphic representation of
the application that is deployed here. You can see that a single pod is
running and is front ended by a service. Note the route that you
configured for this service is also shown. You will also see the *Add to
Project* button on the top. This can be used to create new application
from Web Console inside this project.

Select *Builds* under *Builds* tab, you will see all the build
configurations. Click onto each build configuration and select the
*Configuration* tab, we will be able to view all the build details.

Select *Pods* under *Applications* tab, you will find a running pod that
is running your application image. Note that it also tells you the node
on which the pod is running and other details about this pod. You will
also see the build pod that had succeeded.

Click onto running pod, it shows the details on the pod. In addition,
metrics, logs and terminal also available for monitoring.

Click on *Terminal* tab, you will be able to access the pod from web
console.

If you click onto the *Metrics* tab under Pod and get an error viewing
metrics on the browser, please do the following:

1.  Open https://hawkular-metrics.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}/hawkular/metrics from a new
tab on the same broswer
2.  Click ``Advanced'' link
3.  Click "Proceed to hawkular-metrics.{{APPS_ADDRESS}} (unsafe)"
4.  Refresh the browser where you login at OpenShift console.

Click *Builds* on left menu and select *Builds*. Select the build name
*time* and then click on *Configuration* tab. Note there are webhook
URLs. We will use them in a later lab exercise. You can start a build
from the Web Console by pressing the *Start Build* button in the right
top corner. It also gives you a command to start the build from CLI.

* Select *Services* under *Applications* tab, you will find the service
created for your application. Click onto one of the services, it shows
all the details about the service along with the option to expose it as
a route.
* Select *Routes* under *Applications* tab, you will see all the routes
in the project. Click onto a route, it shows all the details for this
route.
* Select *Deployments* under *Applications* tab, you will see all the
deployments. Click onto a deployment, it shows all the details of the
deployment. By pressing the *Deploy* button, you will be able to start a
deployment from the web console.
* Select *Monitoring* tab, you will see all the events for the project.
Also latest events grouped by resource type.
* Select *Images* under *Builds* tab, it shows the list of image streams
for the project. Click onto the specific image stream, it shows more
details about the image stream.

Click on the *Resources* tab on the left to see that it would display
the Quotas and Other Resources, if they exist. We will deal with them in
a different lab exercise.
