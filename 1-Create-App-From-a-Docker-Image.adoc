Create an App from a Docker image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab you will learn how to create a new project on OpenShift and
how to create an application from an existing docker image.

*Step 1: Add a new project from command line*

*Note:* Please replace *UserName* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

....
$ oc new-project mycliproject-UserName --description="My CLI Project" --display-name="CLI Project"
....

Upon project creation, OpenShift will automatically switch to the newly
created project/namespace. If you wish to view the list of projects, run
the following command:

....
$ oc get projects
....

If you have more than one project, you can switch to a different one by
issuing `oc project <project name>`. Although you donâ€™t want to do it
now.

You can also check the status of the project by running the following
command. It says that the project is currently not running anything.

....
$ oc status

In project CLI Project (mycliproject-UserName)

You have no services, deployment configs, or build configs.
Run 'oc new-app' to create an application.
....

*Step 2: Create an application from a Docker Image*

Next we will create an application inside the above project using an
existing docker image. We will be using a very simple docker image on
dockerhub that just says 'Welcome to OpenShift V3. Let us just use
that for this exercise.

First create a new application using the docker image using the
`oc new-app` command as shown below:

....
$ oc new-app redhatworkshops/welcome-php --name=welcome

--> Found Docker image f001b13 (8 months old) from Docker Hub for "redhatworkshops/welcome-php"

    * An image stream will be created as "welcome:latest" that will track this image
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "welcome"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "welcome"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "welcome"
    * WARNING: Image "redhatworkshops/welcome-php" runs as the 'root' user which may not be permitted by your cluster administrator

--> Creating resources with label app=welcome ...
    imagestream "welcome" created
    deploymentconfig "welcome" created
    service "welcome" created
--> Success
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
....

The above command uses the docker image to deploy a docker container in
a pod. If you quickly run `oc get pods` you will notice that a deployer
pod runs and it starts an application pod as shown below.

....
$ oc get pods

NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-deploy   1/1       Running   0          1m
welcome-1-dkyyq    0/1       Pending   0          0s
....

In the above example `welcome-1-deploy` is the deployer pod and the
other one is the actual application pod. In a little while the deployer
pod will succeed and the application pod will change for `Pending` to
`Running` status.

....
$ oc get pods

NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-dkyyq   1/1       Running   0          56s
....

*Step 3: Add a Route for your application*

OpenShift also spins up a service for this application. Run the
following command to view the list of services in the project (you
can also use `oc get svc` shorthand).

....
$ oc get services

NAME      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
welcome   172.30.77.93   <none>        8080/TCP   2m
....

You will notice the `welcome` service was created for this project.

However, there is no route for this application yet. So you cannot
access this application from outside.

Now add a route to the service with the following command. `oc expose`
command will allow you to expose your service to the world so that you
can access it from the browser.

NOTE: The `--hostname` attribute in the command below is not required properly as we are using
a wildcard dns in our cluster, in our case it is `*.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}`, so if you skip using it, your route is going to be defined by OpenShift.
....
$ oc expose service welcome --name=welcome --hostname=welcome.UserName..{{APPS_ADDRESS}}

NAME      HOST/PORT                     PATH      SERVICE   LABELS
welcome   welcome.UserName.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}             welcome
....

*Step 4: Try your application*

Access the application: Now access the application using curl (looking
for 200 status code) or from the browser and see the result

....
$ curl -Is http://welcome.UserName.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}
....

Voila!! you created your first application using an existing docker
image on OpenShift.

*Step 4: Clean up*

Run the `oc get all` command to view all the components that were
created in your project.

....
$ oc get all

NAME      TYPE      SOURCE
NAME      TYPE      STATUS    POD
NAME      DOCKER REPO                   TAGS      UPDATED
welcome   redhatworkshops/welcome-php   latest    5 hours ago
NAME      TRIGGERS                    LATEST VERSION
welcome   ConfigChange, ImageChange   1
CONTROLLER   CONTAINER(S)   IMAGE(S)                             SELECTOR                                        REPLICAS
welcome-1    welcome        redhatworkshops/welcome-php:latest   deployment=welcome-1,deploymentconfig=welcome   1
NAME      HOST/PORT                     PATH      SERVICE   LABELS
welcome   welcome.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}             welcome
NAME      LABELS    SELECTOR                   IP(S)           PORT(S)
welcome   <none>    deploymentconfig=welcome   172.30.155.37   80/TCP
NAME              READY     REASON    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-8d7nk   1/1       Running   0          4h
....

Now you can delete all these components by running one command.

....
$ oc delete all --all

imagestream "welcome" deleted
deploymentconfig "welcome" deleted
route "welcome" deleted
service "welcome" deleted
pod "welcome-1-ynedb" deleted
....

You will notice that it has deleted the imagestream for the application,
the deploymentconfig, the service and the route.

You can run `oc get all` again to make sure the project is empty.

Congratulations!! You now know how to create a project, an application
using an external docker image and navigate around. Get ready for more
fun stuff!
