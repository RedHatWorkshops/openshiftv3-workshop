# Binary input sources 

## Introduction

In the past you have seen how OpenShift can take your existing java code, build it and deploy the resultant docker image as an application. OpenShift S2I process includes an assemble script that copies the source code from a git repository,  invokes a maven build, places the resultant war file in the deployments folder, builds a new application image and pushes that image into the registry.

But how about if you want OpenShift to deploy a war file that you built yourself?

In this exercise you will learn to deploy a war file. We will assume that you built your source code outside of OpenShift build process and have the means to download the WAR file on your workstation.

## Step 1

Create a war file and place it in deployments directory under a folder of your choice

As an example here I have a WAR file called `petstore.war` that I renamed to ROOT.war and placed in the deployments folder (you can download this example WAR file [HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VeerMuchandi/ps/master/deployments/ROOT.war) )

```
$ ls -lR
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 3 veer staff 102 Jul 5 2015 deployments

./deployments:
total 12024
-rwxr-xr-x 1 veer staff 6155452 Jul 5 2015 ROOT.war
```

## Step 2

Create a new build using the builder image of your choice. Here I am using JBoss EWS (tomcat 8) image. The flag `binary=true` indicates that this build will use the binary content instead of the url to the source code.

Here I am naming my application as “myapp”. So all the artifacts will get the name “myapp”

```
$ oc new-build --image-stream=jboss-webserver30-tomcat8-openshift --binary=true --name=myapp
--> Found image 298446b (4 weeks old) in image stream "jboss-webserver30-tomcat8-openshift" in project "openshift" under tag "latest" for "jboss-webserver30-tomcat8-openshift"

JBoss Web Server 3.0
--------------------
Platform for building and running web applications on JBoss Web Server 3.0 - Tomcat v8

Tags: builder, java, tomcat8

* A source build using binary input will be created
* The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "myapp:latest"

--> Creating resources with label build=myapp ...
imagestream "myapp" created
buildconfig "myapp" created
--> Success
```

## Step 3

Now create the application with the same name as what you gave for the build.

Here again I am using the name “myapp”, so that the rest of the objects such as deployment configuration and service  are created with the same name and refer to the image-stream created earlier.

```
$ oc new-app myapp
--> Found image ed346c5 (35 seconds old) in image stream myapp under tag "latest" for "myapp"

bin-test/myapp-1:aa174140
-------------------------
Platform for building and running web applications on JBoss Web Server 3.0 - Tomcat v8

Tags: builder, java, tomcat8

* This image will be deployed in deployment config "myapp"
* Ports 8080/tcp, 8443/tcp, 8778/tcp will be load balanced by service "myapp"
* Other containers can access this service through the hostname "myapp"

--> Creating resources with label app=myapp ...
deploymentconfig "myapp" created
service "myapp" created
--> Success
Run 'oc status' to view your app.
```

Now, expose the service as a route to be able to use it from the browser.
 
```
$ oc expose svc myapp
route "myapp" exposed
```

You can use the route to access the application using the URL.
