Rollback Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab we will see how we can rollback an application in OpenShift
quickly without switching to an older version of the source code in SCM.

In this Lab we will:

* Use the same app we deployed in previous Web Hooks Lab. If you haven’t, please
complete that Lab first.
* Rollback the application using the OpenShift v3 command ``rollback''.

*Step 1: Check application health status*

* Run:

....
$ oc get pods

NAME                    READY     STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
scm-web-hooks-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          1h
scm-web-hooks-2-85bkw   1/1       Running     0          18m
scm-web-hooks-2-build   0/1       Completed   0          19m
....

* Inspecting the output of the above command we can see that we have a
single replica of the previously deployed application running.
* We can also see that previously two pods were used to build the
application. OpenShift will create and docker deploy a pod per
deployment. This tells us that we currently have two versions of the
application.
* You can also use:

....
$ oc get dc

NAME            REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
scm-web-hooks   2          1         1         config,image(scm-web-hooks:latest)
....

* The latest and active version for the application is *2*
* If we display the application in the browser we see:

*Step 2: Rollback the application*

* Using the previous command we ran to retrieve the deployment
configuration, we will revert or rollback to version 1.

....
$ oc rollback scm-web-hooks --to-version=1
#3 rolled back to scm-web-hooks-1
....

* If we re-run the command to list the build configurations, we now see:

....
$ oc get dc

NAME            REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
scm-web-hooks   3          1         1         config,image(scm-web-hooks:latest)
....

* So OpenShift has rolled back the application to version 1 and created
a new build configuration.
* Reloading the application now displays:
